# Tokenomics
Know how to design the most efficient tokenomics.

## Glossary
* __Max supply__: tokens that will ever be generated
* __Total supply__: tokens that exist currently = `circulating + locked - burned`
* __Circulating supply__: tokens that are in circulation i.e. liquid amount like tradable,
* __Locked tokens__: tokens that are staked or locked into some contract i.e. non-liquid

> Noticing the supply of a token can be a good indicator of its future. The circulating supply of a token is increased by developers by active mining. If the circulating supply keeps increasing, then investors can expect the value of the token to go up. On the contrary, if too many tokens are released, the value might drop as well.

* __Marketcap of a token__: `Market price * circulating supply`


## Factors
* More the token's circulating supply => token price would be more volatile.
* More the tokens locked => token price would be less volatile.
* Token locking can be done in these ways:
	- Timelock the tokens
	- Vest the tokens
	- Stake the tokens into a contract (escrow or staking).

> Here, all the tokens are locked for a duration.
